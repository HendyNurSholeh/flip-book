This project is a fun and interactive way to display images in a flip-book style using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Please watch the tutorial from Coding Star on youtube(link below). The flip-book is fully customizable using CSS, so feel free to experiment with the styling to make it your own. You can also add your own images to the flip-book by replacing the existing images in the img folder and updating the JavaScript code accordingly. Overall, this project is a great way to practice your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills while creating a fun and interactive flip-book experience. We hope you enjoy it!
